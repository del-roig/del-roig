- ðŸ‘‹ Hello my name is Del.  I having been developing back-end applications for over 20 years now but until the past 6 years I haven't had the need to develop anything on the front-end.  
That has all changed now and I have been excited to explore this new world.  There is so much at your fingertips to explore and develop w/out the need for a large enterprise 
application.  That makes this adventure one that is only limited by the amount of time and effort one wishes to put in.
